# logging
Logging library for dotnet 5

File Logger for dotnet core (C#)

Logging to file and file rolling is blocking code as a lock is used. Not polished code. Unit tests are path dependent. Feel free to use, copy and adapt.

Written for a console app with light logging so may not suited for other app types. 

Developed and tested on Windows 10 NTFS

Successfully used on Linux (Raspian, Debian)
