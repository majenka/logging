# logging
Logging library for dotnet 5

Basic File Logger for dotnet core (C#)

Written for a console app with light logging so possibly not suited for other app types. Logging to file and file rolling is blocking code as a lock is used. Not polished code. Low level unit tests (path dependent). Feel free to use, copy and adapt.

Developed and tested on Windows 10 NTFS

Successfully used on Linux (Raspian, Debian)
